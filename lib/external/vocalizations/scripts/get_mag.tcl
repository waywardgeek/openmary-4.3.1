# get_mag.tcl : Fourier magnitudes extraction script using snack.
# It has as input the raw signal and its residual signal obtained by 
# inverse filtering. 
# The residual signal can be generated with SPTK, using inverse filtering, ex:
#   x2x +sf tmp.raw | frame +f -p 80 | window -w 1 -n 1 | gcep -g 2 -m 24 > tmp.gcep
#   x2x +sf tmp.raw | iglsadf -k -g 2 -m 24 -p 80 tmp.gcep  > tmp.residual
#
