# This file is contains a non-exhaustive particle list in EWTS (wylie) and is
# to be used by the Tibetan Tokeniser.
# It is an extension of the lexicon-file which, both in combination, serve an algorithm
# for parsing syllables into words.
# The file format is such: 
# Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. 
# Each content line contains two fields separated by a backslash: 
# 1) the particle
# 2) indication whether the partcile is a syllable itself and as such
#    never attached to another syllable (s) or whether it is an enclitic
#    particle (e)
