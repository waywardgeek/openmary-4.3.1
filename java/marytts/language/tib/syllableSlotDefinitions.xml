This file contains the categorisation of Tibetan consonants into the slots of
a syllable that they can occur in. Furthermore, it contains the delimiters of 
tibetan sentences and syllables. As such the file is used for segmentation of tibetan text 
by the Tokeniser-class of the Tibetan MARY-System.

At program start the general symbols lists (general) are read in as well as the 
slot-lists (definitions). The former contains the tibetan alphabet, additionally subdivided
into vowels and consonants while the latter contains the categorisation of the
consonants according to the slot they occur in as well as possible delimiters. The 
delimiters are in the definitions-section because what they actually delimit is a matter
of interpretation and comparison to our language and may not generally be said to hold true.

All Lists in this xml-File contain single items that are separated by a %-sign.
