I have said this for the third time now!
Oh, I'm so excited! I can hardly await it!
Help, there's a monster coming behind me!
Go away now! I am fed up with you!
Will you finally leave me alone!
Wow, I am delighted for you!
Today is really a nice day.
And they lived happily ever after.
Ah, stop bugging me with that nonsense.
It's all too late now. I give up.
Man, it's so boring here.
